## üî¨ **Technical Implementation**

### **Exercise Selection Logic:**
```python
# Analysis only starts when both conditions are met:
if exercise_selected and exercise_analyzing:
    # Perform real-time analysis
    status, feedback, score, metrics = analyze_with_llm(category, action, kps)
```

### **Voice Feedback Integration:**
```python
# Format feedback for natural speech
voice_text = format_voice_feedback(feedback, score, exercise_name)
# Send to ElevenLabs API via backend
send_voice_feedback(voice_text)
```

### **Enhanced Display:**
```python
# Show form score, session time, and status
draw_control_overlay(category, action, info_lines, 
                   exercise_selected, session_duration, current_form_score)
```
