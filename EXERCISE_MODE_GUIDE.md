- **Feedback**: Real-time form corrections and depth guidance

### **2. Push-up Analysis**
- **Ideal Form**: Elbow angle 80-100°, body line ≥175° straight
- **Scoring**: Elbow angle (40%), body line (35%), arm symmetry (20%), stability (5%)
- **Feedback**: Range of motion and body alignment tips

### **3. Bicep Curl Analysis**
- **Ideal Form**: Top ~50°, bottom ~160°, stable upper arm
- **Scoring**: Top position (30%), bottom position (20%), stability (25%), ROM (25%)
- **Feedback**: Range of motion and form stability coaching

## 🎮 **Exercise Mode Controls**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` | Previous exercise (squat ← pushup ← bicep_curl) |
| `k` | Next exercise (squat → pushup → bicep_curl) |
| `r` | Reset session (clear metrics) |
| `q` | Quit application |

## 📊 **Scoring System**

### **Score Ranges:**
- **85-100**: ✅ **Correct** - Excellent form
- **70-84**: ⚠️ **Improvable** - Good with minor issues
- **0-69**: ❌ **Poor** - Needs significant improvement

### **Scientific Basis:**
- **Multi-dimensional analysis** of joint angles
- **Biomechanical scoring** based on research
- **Progressive penalty system** for form deviations
- **Symmetry assessment** for bilateral exercises

---

## 🧠 **LLM Enhancement**

The exercise analysis includes **advanced AI coaching**:

- **Cerebras LLM integration** for scientific optimization
- **Dynamic scoring** based on biomechanical analysis
- **Personalized feedback** with exercise-specific tips
- **Real-time form corrections** with coaching cues

### **LLM Features:**
- Adjusts scoring based on form quality (30-100 range)
- Provides scientific biomechanical assessments
- Offers personalized coaching advice
- Considers movement consistency and effort

## 📈 **Real-time Metrics**

### **Live Feedback:**
- **Current score** for each rep/position
- **Session overall score** across all reps
- **Exercise-specific metrics** (angles, symmetry, ROM)
- **Form correction tips** with actionable advice

### **Session Tracking:**
- **Duration** of exercise session
- **Number of reps/corrections** performed
- **Overall performance** trends
- **Missing body parts** alerts (if camera can't see you)

## 🔬 **Technical Details**

### **Exercise Analysis Functions:**

1. **`_analyze_exercise_squat()`**:
   - Measures knee and torso angles
   - Assesses left/right leg symmetry
   - Evaluates depth consistency
   - Provides biomechanical feedback

2. **`_analyze_exercise_pushup()`**:
   - Analyzes elbow angles for full ROM
   - Checks body line alignment
   - Measures arm symmetry
   - Assesses core stability

3. **`_analyze_exercise_bicep()`**:
   - Tracks top and bottom positions
   - Monitors upper arm stability
   - Measures range of motion
   - Evaluates movement control

### **Pose Requirements:**
- **Full body visibility** recommended for squats
- **Upper body focus** sufficient for push-ups and bicep curls  
- **Clear joint landmarks** needed for accurate analysis
- **Stable camera position** for consistent tracking

---

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

### **Camera Setup:**
1. **Position camera** at chest height
2. **Ensure full body** is visible (especially for squats)
3. **Good lighting** for clear pose detection
4. **Stable camera** to avoid tracking issues

### **Exercise Performance:**
1. **Start with proper form** over speed
2. **Follow the feedback** for corrections
3. **Use controlled movements** for better analysis
4. **Reset session** when switching exercises

### **Troubleshooting:**
- **"No person detected"** → Step back or adjust camera angle
- **Low scores** → Focus on form over speed
- **Missing body parts** → Ensure full visibility in camera frame
